# my-portfolio
This is my portfolio as a Front-end Web Developer!

You can see the working site at [here](http://kkas.github.io/FEND-Project-P1-Build-A-Portfolio-Site/)!

## Task running
* `grunt images`
  * Run this to regenerate all the images, including optimization.

* `grunt optimize`
  * Run this only you want to optimize images
